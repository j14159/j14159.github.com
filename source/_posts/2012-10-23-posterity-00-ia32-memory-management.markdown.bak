Roughly 10 years ago, [Cameron](http://www.semisafe.com/) and I were roommates.  At the time, he was getting into computer security and talking about NOP-sleds and shell code and I ranted about how the Intel memory model _could_ prevent it if people used it correctly.  Thankfully he talked me out of writing something antagonistic and an [introduction to Intel memory management](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/84389790/memory.pdf) resulted.

There are some notable weaknesses including:

* no mention of how caching figures in
* little to no talk of actually securing things
* it's IA32, so kind of out of date

Nevertheless, I figured it might be of interest to some people so [share and enjoy](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/84389790/memory.pdf).
